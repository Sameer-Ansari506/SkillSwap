# SkillSwap Web

React + Vite frontend for the SkillSwap platform.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update `VITE_API_URL` to your backend URL plus any optional secrets such as `VITE_CLIENT_ID`.
3. `npm run dev` to start Vite on port 5173.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start development server
- `npm run build` – Build production bundle
- `npm run start` – Preview production build
- `npm run test` – Run Vitest + React Testing Library
- `npm run lint` – ESLint

## Auth Notes

Access tokens are stored in memory/localStorage for simplicity. Replace with httpOnly cookies for higher security and update the API client accordingly.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes. Global styles live in `src/index.css` (generated by Vite).
